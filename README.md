# Autonomous Robot that Fetches My Darn "Kærgården" Butter

Should be made using:
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Maybe 9g servos or the big yellow ones
- Some kind of module making it possible to have multiple servos for hands and wheels (16 bit channel something or the other...)
- Ultrasonic sensor to detect how close I am to butter, other objects, and to make sure that dummy doesn't fall off the edge of tables
- Fusion 360
- Prusa MK4 3D printer
- Raspberry Pi Camera
- Specifically trained on "kærgården" butter lightweight object detection model (YOLOv3 or similar)
- Lightweight speech detection model (forgot the name, but I got that shit working)
- Sheer will

- path finding. When I get the guy to be able to drive I don't know how it should know where on the table to look for the butter

- Small speaker to hear his responses
- When it detects butter it should turn so that the butter is in the middle of the camera's POV then start moving towards it until the ultrasonic sensor tells it that it is close enough.
